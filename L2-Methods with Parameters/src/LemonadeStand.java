        You run a very successful Lemonade Stand.

        You sell 16 oz. cups of lemonade for $0.50 and
        20 oz. cups of lemonade for $0.99.

        You also have to report your income to the IRS,
        so you include a 7.5% sales tax on all purchases.

        Create a program which will ask the number of 16oz and 20oz cups of lemonade and display the total cost with tax.

        Your program should include at least ONE method with two parameters.
